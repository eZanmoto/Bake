The Reason For Bake
===================

Sean Kelleher
-------------

### Key

The main goal of bake is to make writing tests easier, by integrating tests into
the build architecture from the start.

### Sub-key

+ To help projects get off to a good start.
+ To help make learning of new languages easier, by giving the developer a
    stable build structure.
+ To help make learning of programming easier, by making it easier for new
    programmers to learn programming without relying too much on IDEs.
+ To help standardize good code and project architectures.
+ To help with the integration of different languages in a single project.
+ To reduce the amount of time taken to set up new projects by using a
	write-once, use again style. If you or another developer figures out how to
	build a particularly tricky project, they can commit that and everyone will
	be able to benefit from that success.
+ To try and decouple project-generation from IDEs, which establish a level of
    hand-holding that is difficult for programmers to diverge from. Some IDEs
    will configure project files behind the scenes, which leaves the programmer
    in the dark when the project is left in a state that the IDE doesn't expect
    and can't handle. Project-generation on its own is helpful, and can help
    programmers skip the boilerplate and launch into the juicy internals of a
    problem.
